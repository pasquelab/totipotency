# totipotency
This repository contains .loom files supplemental to the article "Defining totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency ". 

As a resource to community we provide .loom files that contain UMAP-clustering, cluster annotation, expression and gene regulatory data from datasets analyzed in the manuscript. 

.loom files can be downloaded here: [loom1](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE145nnn/GSE145609/suppl/GSE145609_Post_implantation_blastoid_data.loom.gz), [loom2](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE145nnn/GSE145609/suppl/GSE145609_Pre_implantation_ESCs_embryo_data.loom.gz)
and after unzipping, browsed interactively using [SCope platform](https://scope.aertslab.org). SCope was developed and is maintained by [Aerts lab.](https://www.aertslab.org/)

In order to browse the datasets, upload loom files by clicking on "Upload dataset" in the menu on the left-side of SCope website. Uploading may take a few minutes. Successful upload will activate a private, temporary session for the user. Each session expires after 5 days, but can be renewed by re-uploading the loom file. 
Standalone SCope apps for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/releases).
