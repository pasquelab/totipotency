# totipotency
This repository contains .loom files supplemental to the article "Defining totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency ". 

As a resource to community we provide .loom files that contain UMAP-clustering, cluster annotation, expression and gene regulatory data from datasets analyzed in the manuscript. 

.loom files can be downloaded here: [loom1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE145609&format=file&file=GSE145609%5Floom%5Fpost%5Fimplant%5Fblastoid%5FEPSCs%2Eloom%2Egz), [loom2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE145609&format=file&file=GSE145609%5Floom%5Fpre%5Fimplant%5FEPSCs%2Eloom%2Egz)
and after unzipping, browsed interactively using [SCope platform](https://scope.aertslab.org). SCope was developed and is maintained by [Aerts lab.](https://www.aertslab.org/)

In order to browse the datasets, upload loom files by clicking on "Upload dataset" in the menu on the left-side of SCope website. Uploading may take a few minutes. Successful upload will activate a private, temporary session for the user. Each session expires after 5 days, but can be renewed by re-uploading the loom file. 
Standalone SCope apps for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/releases).
